    <h1>Lucy's Favorite Homemade Snacks:</h1>
        <p> Lucy loves to eat. It has been difficult purchasing Lucy treats because there is a lot of known named brands that she does not like. I decided to make her some treats myself and have had great results. Most of the recipes have the same ingredients or are somewhat made the same which is convienient. Here are some of her favorites. </p>

        <p> <img src="sardine-cat-treats-step-5-0120-2000.jpg" alt="marthastewartrecipe" style="width:100%"> One of Lucys favorites! This 3 ingredient treat is perfect if your cat is a fan of sardines. It's super easy to make and 1 batch will last a week. <br> <a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/7592215/how-make-homemade-cat-treats">

        <p> <img src="homemade-cat-treats-finished-with-hand.jpg" alt="mysweetprecision" style="width:100%"> <img src="homemade-cat-treats-finished.jpg" alt="homemade" style="width:100%"> <img src="sweetprecision.jpg" alt="mysweetprecision" style="width:100%"> Another favorite. These are not as crispy as they look, but you have the option of baking them longer.  <br> <a href="https://mysweetprecision.com/chewy-cat-treats/#recipe-card">

        <p> <img src="Pumpkin-Kitty-Bits.jpg" alt="heartcookies" style="width:100%"> <img src="pumkinandsalmotreats.jpg" alt="ingredients" style="width:100%"> I was surprised to find out Lucy liked pumpkin.

        <p> <img src="catniptunatreat.jpg" alt="dailypaws" style="width:100%"> <img src="servings.jpg" alt="servings" style="width:100%"> This is the perfect recipe if you have more than one cat. It has a big serving so it should last you 4-6 days depending on the amount of treats you give your cats. <br> <a href="https://www.dailypaws.com/cats-kittens/cat-nutrition/homemade-cat-food/tuna-catnip-cat-treats-recipe">

        <p> <img src="heartcookies.jpg" alt="heartcookies" style="width:100%"> <img src="heartcookiesingredients.jpg" alt="ingredients" style="width:100%"> This recipe is similar to the one above. I made this one with rice and added the catnip. Lucy loved them.

        <p> <img src="catcookiesandmilk.jpg" alt="owner" style="width:100%"> <img src="cookiesandmilkcat.jpg" alt="catcookiesandmilk" style="width:100%"> I honestly have not made this recipe but it will be my next! I chose this one mainly because the kitten looks so adorable with his milk and cookies. <br> <a href="https://spoonuniversity.com/recipe/cat-ultimate-christmas-cookie">
