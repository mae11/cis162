    <h1> About Lucy:</h1>
    <p> Welcome. 
        <br>
        This is my cat Lucy. She is a playful but high maintence siamese cat. To be honest, I have always preferred dogs because cats seemed so evil. When I came across Lucy last year, all the negative feelings I had about cats changed. She was only a 1.5 months old and so shy. Now she is a full year old and wild in the streets! 
    <br>
    She loves to play outside but can also be very lazy. She has a huge appetite but is also extremely picky. I figured I could share tips to other furparents with picky cats on her behalf.
